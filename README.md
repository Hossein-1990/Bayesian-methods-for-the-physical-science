# Bayesian-methods-for-the-physical-science
Description
-----------
Bayesian methods for the physical science (by Stefano Andreon and Brian Weaver) is the title of a precious book which is full of bayesian examples in physics (with emphasis on astronomy). Originally this book is written in R (or more accurate, JAGS package). Since this realm of statistics is important for astronomy and cosmology, I've decided to convert some codes in this book to its python version. 

Folders:
----------
- Basic function: this has a notebook in which I gave a simple and renowned example in bayesian analysis (coin flipping) to introduce some aspects of pymc3 library.
- Mathamtical proof: several mathematical proofs in bayesian analysis wchich may help researchers.
- chapters 3 ,4 : these folders cover the pyhton version of many examples ih the mentioned book. 

Notes:
------
- For implementing bayesian analysis, I've used the pymc3 package
- There are multiple MCMC methods which is available in this package, but the best way (as its site has suggested!) is to leave this task to the program!
