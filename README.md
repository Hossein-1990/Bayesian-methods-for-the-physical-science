# Bayesian-methods-for-the-physical-science
Description
-----------
Bayesian methods for the physical science is the title of a precious book which is full of bayesian examples in physics (with emphasis on astronomy). Originally this book is written in R (or more accurate, JAGS package). Since this realm of statistics is important for astronomy and cosmology, I've decided to convert some the codes in this book to its python version. 

Notes:
------
- For implementing bayesian analysis, I've used the pymc3 package
- There are multiple MCMC methods which is available in this package, but the best way (as its site has suggested!) is to leave this task to the program!
- I've uploaded (and will upload!) the codes in 2 different versions: .ipynb (for observing the results) and .py (for downloading and using codes)
