# Bayesian-methods-for-the-physical-science
Description
-----------
Bayesian methods for the physical science is a book full of bayesian examples in physics (with emphasis on astronomy). The programming language for this book is R (or more accurate, JAGS package). Since this realm of statistics is important for astronomy, I've decided to convert the codes in this book to python codes.
